# mocha-chai tests
When I realised that Mocha is not a coffee and Chai is not a tea for me anymore :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Description
This repository contains samples of writing unit tests using Mocha and Chai. The tests can be run in two modes:

* In browser

In this mode, you'll need to first `clone this repo` and then click on `test.html`. 

* In Node.js

1. In this mode, you'll need to first `clone this repo` and then execute `npm install` inside `node_js_testing` directory.

2. Next run the tests by typing `mocha`.
